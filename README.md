# Psychic Game Project

## Summary and Goals

The goal of this project was to create a game that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by our JavaScript code. The computer generates a random letter (math.floor function) and the player has 9 guesses to find the correct answer. As you play, the game records: Current Guesses, Guesses Left, Wins and Losses. The game resets each time after the 9 guesses are achieved or the correct answer is chosen.
